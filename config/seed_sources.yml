# AI Constraints Radar — SEED Source Registry
# ============================================================================
# This is a BOOTSTRAP file. These 28 sources are the starting points.
# The system ALSO discovers new sources automatically via:
#
#   1. Web search sweeps — periodic broad searches for constraint keywords
#      across the open web (Google News, Bing News, etc.) to find articles
#      from publications not in this list
#   2. Citation/link extraction — every ingested article's outbound links
#      and cited sources are extracted. If a new domain appears repeatedly
#      with relevant constraint content, it becomes a source candidate.
#   3. Source promotion — new domains follow:
#      DISCOVERED (first seen) → PROVISIONAL (3+ relevant articles) →
#      CONFIRMED (6+ articles, scored for reliability/earliness)
#   4. Operator can also manually add sources at any time via dashboard
#
# The seed sources below are loaded at init to give the collector
# something to work with on day one. After that, the source registry
# lives in Postgres and grows continuously.
#
# Fetch methods:
#   rss          — standard RSS/Atom feed
#   scrape_html  — HTTP GET + trafilatura/newspaper extraction
#   scrape_js    — Playwright (JS-rendered pages)
#   api          — structured API call
#   pdf_monitor  — check page for new PDF links, download + extract
#   web_search   — periodic keyword search via news API / search engine
#
# Tiers:
#   1 = earliest/highest signal (supplier earnings, trade pubs, gov)
#   2 = confirmation (reputable finance press, wires)
#   3 = discovery only (social, blogs — never sole basis for alerts)
